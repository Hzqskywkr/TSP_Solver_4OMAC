# TSP_Solver_4OMAC
This is the code for TSP_Solver using OMAC.'TSP_Solver.py' is a TSP instance solver, which uses the asynchronous HNN algorithm to solve the TSP instances.
‘utils.py’ contains some auxiliary functions such as reading TSP files, QUBO modeling, matrix quantization.
2 TSP instances (burma14.xml,ulysses16.xml) are selected from the TSP database http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/. 'test10.xml' is a tsp instance constructed by myself. The files ending with '.tsp' correspond to the coordinates of each city in the '.xml' file and are used for subsequent plotting.
